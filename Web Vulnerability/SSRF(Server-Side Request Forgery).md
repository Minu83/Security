It's a vulnerability that allows a malicious user to cause the webserver to make an additional or edited HTTP request to the resource of the attacker's choosing.

Types of SSRF:

- regular SSRF - where data is returned to attacker's screen
- Blind SSRF - where SSRF occurs, but no information returned to attacker's screen

Successful SSRF attack:

- Access to unauthorized areas.
- Access to customer/organizational data.
- Ability to Scale to internal networks.
- Reveal authentication tokens/credentials


Potential SSRF vulnerabilities can be spotted in web applications in many different ways. Here is an example of four common places to look:

- **When a full URL is used in a parameter in the address bar**
- **A hidden field in a form**
- **A partial URL such as just the hostname**
- **Or perhaps only the path of the URL**

If working with a blind SSRF where no output is reflected back to you, you'll need to use an external HTTP logging tool to monitor requests such as requestbin.com, your own HTTP server or Burp Suite's Collaborator client.
