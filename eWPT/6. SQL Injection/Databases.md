Introduction to Databases and DBMS

Databases
A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that makes it easy to manage, access and update
Databases are used in a variety of applications, including business applications, websites and mobile apps, to store and manage large amounts of structured or unstructured data. Some examples of data that can be stored in a database include customer information, financial records, product inventory and employee records

Database Management Systems(DBMS)

DBMS is a software system that enables users to create, store, organize, manage and retrieve data from database
DBMS provides an interface between the user and the database, allowing users to interact with the database without having to understand technical details
Examples of popular DBMS:
-MySQL
-PostgreSQL
-Oracle Database
-Microsoft SQL Server

Types of Databases:
- Relational Databases - A database that organizes data into one or more tables or relations, where each table represents an entity or a concept, and the column of the table represent the attributes of that entity or concept
- NoSQL Databases - A type of database that does not use the traditional tabular relations used in relational databases. Instead uses a variety of data models to store and access data
- Object-oriented Databases - A database that stores data  as objects rather than in tables, allowing for more complex data structures and relationships

SQL Databases are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns and use SQL as their standard language for managing data.
