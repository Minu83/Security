DNS Enumeration


A valuable resource for this information is the Domain Name System(DNS).
We can query DNS to identify the DNS records associated with a particular domain or IP address.
DNS is a protocol that is used to resolve domain names/hostnames to IP addresses.
A plethora of public DNS servers have been set up by companies like Cloudflare(1.1.1.1) and Google(8.8.8.8). These DNS servers contain the records of almost all domains on the internet.


In linux console:
