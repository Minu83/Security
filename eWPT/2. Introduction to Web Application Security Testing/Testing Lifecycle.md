The OWASP Web Security Guide(WSTG) is a comprehensive and community-driven resource provided by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)


OWASP WSTG Checklist

The OWASP Web Security Testing Checklist is an spreadsheet based checklist that can be used to help you track the status of completed and pending test cases.
This checklist is based in OWASP Web Security Testing Guide and includes a comprehensive penetration testing methodology/framework that web app pentesters can implement in their pentests or security assessments.
It also provides a set of detailed and granular web app security tests that outline the various techniques that can be used to test most common web application misconfigurations, flaws or/and vulnerabilities.
Moreover, the checklist also contains the OWASP Risk Assessment Calculator and the Summary Findings template.


Pre-Engagement Phase

The pre-engagement phase of web application penetration testing is a crucial step that lays the foundation for a successful and well-planned security assessment.
It involves preliminary preparations, understanding project requirements, and obtaining necessary authorizations before initiating the actual testing.
During the pre-engagement phase, the penetration tester and the client must discuss and agree upon a number of legal and technical details pertinent to the execution and outcomes of the security assessment.
This can be one or more documents with the objective to define the following:
- Objectives & Scope of the engagement
- Timeline & milestones
- Liabilities & responsibility
- Authorized actions
- Expectations and deliverables
- Statement of work

Pre-engagement Steps:

- Understanding Project Objectives:
		- Clearly define the objectives and goals of the penetration testing
		- Understanding what the stakeholders aim to achieve through the testing process
- Scope Definition:
	-Identify the scope of the penetration test, including the specific web applications, URLs, and functionalities to be tested
		- Define the scope of boundaries and limitations, such as which systems  or networks are out-of-scope for testing
- Authorization and Legal Requitements:
	-Obtain proper authorization from the organization's management or application owners to conduct the penetration test
	-Ensure that the testing activities comply with any legal or regulatory requirements, and that all relevant permissions are secured
- Rules of Engagement (RoE):
	-Establish a set of Rules of engagement that outline the specific rules, constraints and guidelines for the testing proccess
	-Include details about testing schedule, testing hours, communication channels and escalation procedures
- Communication and Coordination:
	-Establish clear communication channels with key stakeholders, including IT personnel, development teams and management
	-Coordinate with relevant personnel to ensure minimal disruption to the production environment during testing
- Contract Non-Disclosure Agreements:
	-sign NDAs
- Scoping Meeting
	-second scoping meeting to make sure nothing changed
- Preparation of Tools and Resources
	-ensure the testing teams has all required tools, licences etc
- Risk Assessment and Acceptance:
	-risk assessment of the potential impact of the penetration test
	-obtain management's acceptance of any risk associated with testing process
- Engagement kick-off:
	-officially kick-off the penetration test
	-share the RoE and any relevant details with testing team
