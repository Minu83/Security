OWASP WSTG Checklist

The OWASP Web Security Testing Checklist is an spreadsheet based checklist that can be used to help you track the status of completed and pending test cases.
This checklist is based in OWASP Web Security Testing Guide and includes a comprehensive penetration testing methodology/framework that web app pentesters can implement in their pentests or security assessments.
It also provides a set of detailed and granular web app security tests that outline the various techniques that can be used to test most common web application misconfigurations, flaws or/and vulnerabilities.
Moreover, the checklist also contains the OWASP Risk Assessment Calculator and the Summary Findings template.
